    Data for exercise 1.

    returns: tuple (X, Y)
        X is a sine and a cosine from 0.0*pi to 1.5*pi
        Y is a sine and a cosine from 1.5*pi to 3.0*pi
    Therefore, Y follows X. There is also a random offset
    commonly applied to X an Y.

    The returned arrays are of shape:
        (seq_length, batch_size, output_dim)
        Therefore: (10, batch_size, 2)

    For this exercise, let's ignore the "isTrain"
    argument and test on the same data.
